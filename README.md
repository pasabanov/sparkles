| 4. Capture and transfer loss detection with no corruption to other captured and transmitted data                            | 游리     |

| 2. Additional simple data, attached to event. (list of integers)                                                            | 游댮     |

| 4. Ranges support: simple, multiplexed (start, and one of predefined end states)                                            | 游댮     |

| 8. Viewer memory limit: dynamically save/load to/from files                                                                 | 游댮     |
